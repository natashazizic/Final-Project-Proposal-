### Sea Level Rise & Coastal Flooding Events 

**Justification:**

Due to climate change impacts, there has been a consistent increase in sea levels across the globe (Vitousek et al. 2017).
This trend is expected to continue as climate change worsens, and will likely have negative impacts on coastal regions (Vitousek et al. 2017).
One of these impacts is flooding events, which will become more frequent as sea levels rise (Vitousek et al. 2017).
There is a known relationship between these occurrences, but we do not yet understand its extent (Taherkhani et al. 2020).
A study published in 2020 predicted that there was an exponential relationship between sea levels and coastal flooding, meaning that as ocean levels slowly increase, coastal regions will experience extremely severe and abundant flooding events (Taherkhani et al. 2020).
Our study aims to dive deeper into this topic.
We want to look at data and trends over the past few decades to determine how sea level and flooding events have been linked, and how this relationship will progress into the future.

**Question:** How does an increase in sea level affect coastal flooding events in the United States?

**Hypothesis:** As sea levels rise, we will see an extreme increase in both frequency and severity of coastal flooding events.

**Methods:**

To understand the relationship between sea level and coastal flooding, we will look at historical data In the United States.
We will look in this area because there is an abundance of available data, and we can examine multiple different land and climate types.
Data will come from NOAA and FEMA.
NOAA has data on historical water levels as well as coastal flood frequency.
FEMA provides many resources for looking at flooding trends and risks.
We will have access to data and maps from these sources, that can be compared to understand past and current relationships.

**Outcomes:**

This study will explain how sea level rise due to climate change has impacted the frequency of coastal flooding events over recent decades.
If our hypothesis is correct, we will conclude that a rise in sea levels will cause an increase in flooding instances.
Additionally, this data can be used to predict changes that will come in the future if global trends continue.
Coastal regions will be made aware that flooding will become more common, and can therefore be more prepared for these upcoming events.

### Sea Level Rise & US Shorelines 

**Justification:**

As our climate changes and global temperatures increase, sea levels are bound to rise.
This will have an impact on shorelines all over the world.
Regardless, coastal development is continuing globally (Gracia et al. 2018).
It is important that we understand the causes for coastal erosion, so we can work towards preventing it (Gracia et al. 2018).
Our goal is to understand how different land types will be affected, and what factors will have the biggest impact on erosion.
Some underlying causes come from climate and storms, ocean currents and tides, land use, and ecosystem types (Łabuz, Tomasz A. 2015).
By understanding which of these factors have the most significant impacts, we can make progress towards fixing this inevitable problem.
During our research, we will be comparing different areas to determine what is the biggest threat to rapid coastal erosion.

**Question:** How have shorelines been altered by sea level rise in the United States over the past 50 years?

**Hypothesis:** Sea level rise will alter shorelines in varying ways across different parts of the country based on factors such as regional climate, ocean currents, surface structure, etc.

**Methods:**

The goal of this study is to understand which factors play the biggest role in increasing rates of coastal erosion.
We will be comparing different regions around the United States.
This will ensure that we can study different types of land use, climate, ecosystems and ocean conditions.
USGS has maps and datasets with information regarding historical shoreline changes and sea level rise.
We can use this information alongside NOAA’s data on water levels.
We will look at different regions around the US and determine which ones are receding the most rapidly.
By comparing this with their conditions, we will be able to estimate the reasons as to why.

**Outcomes:** In this study, we will look at how sea level rise is changing the shoreline of the United States.
We will gain a deeper understanding of how these changes are made and what outside factors alter shoreline appearance and structure.
If our hypothesis is correct, we will conclude that over time, sea level rise will cause shorelines to change, but this will not be a uniform transformation across these coastlines, but will instead vary greatly from region to region.

### Manatee Birth Rates and its Connection to Rising Ocean Temperatures 

**Justification:**

The Florida Keys mangroves are one of the most diverse ecosystems, providing a multitude of resources, ecosystem services and mitigation against natural disasters such as hurricanes (Kathiersan, 2012).
Manatees are a key species in these ecosystems and we want to learn more about their reproduction patterns, if the ocean temperature prohibits manatees from birthing in these areas and what the preferred temperatures for births might be.
We are also interested in whether migration affects the birth rate of manatees and how that could be linked to ocean temperatures as well.
Since manatees are an endangered species (Littles, et al, 2026), we hope that this research will tell us more about how climate change, increased ocean temperatures and global warming are affecting this species and what can be done to protect this species.
Although there are many factors that impact manatee birth rates, we will be primarily focusing on its correlation specifically to ocean temperature.

**Research question:** How are manatee birth rates being affected by rising ocean temperatures?

**Proposed Methods:**

For this study, we are planning on looking at manatee birth rates from the last 20 years specifically in the Florida Keys.
We are planning on getting this data from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.
We are also going to be getting data about the local ocean temperatures from NOAA’s national data buoy center that records temperatures daily at Peterson Key.
This will be a temporal and possibly spatial study- we want to see if there are any changes over time about the manatee birth rates and possibly see if the birth rates change because of ocean temperatures in certain areas.
To find our results, we will do a correlation test, time series analysis and possibly a linear regression analysis.

**Expected Outcomes:**

We are expecting to find results about specific factors about manatee birth rates to see if/how they are correlated to rising ocean water temperatures.
We are hoping to see if the rise of ocean temperatures might also affect things such as migration patterns and what that could mean for the local mangrove ecosystems.
